# Running tests

tldr; this is the preferred way to execute

`python -m unittest discover tests`

-- OR --

`coverage run --source="./app,tests" -m unittest discover tests`

Then

`coverage html`


## Syntax reference (assuming running from `D:\src\github\proj\`)

1.  Run all tests; Not ideal because this will also trigger `flask_app.py`
`python -m unittest discover`
`python -m unittest` (this is same as above)

2.  Run all tests in selected directory; this is the preferred approach
`python -m unittest discover <test_directory>`

3.  Run all tests in selected directory that match specified filename pattern
`python -m unittest discover -s <directory> -p '*_test.py'`

## Running coverage

Use this to discover uncovered files.

`coverage run --source="./forum_app,tests" -m unittest discover tests`

Use this to only calculate coverage for tested files.

`coverage run -m unittest discover tests `

Then use one of the following to generate a report.

 `coverage report`
-- OR --
`coverage html`
